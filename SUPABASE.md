# Supabase setup

1. Create a Supabase project.
2. In the Supabase SQL Editor, run [`supabase/schema.sql`](./supabase/schema.sql).
   This creates the per-user video table and row-level security policies.
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the project URL and anon
   (publishable) key from **Project Settings → API**.
4. In **Authentication → URL Configuration**, set the site URL to your app's
   address and add local/deployed callback URLs if needed.
5. Make sure the Email provider is enabled under **Authentication → Sign In /
   Providers**.
6. Start the app with `npm run dev`, create an account with your email and
   password, then sign in. If email confirmation is enabled, confirm the email
   before signing in. You can turn off email confirmation in Supabase if you
   want to sign up without verifying an email address.

The Supabase anon/publishable key is intended for browser use; never put a
service-role key in a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variable. Row-level security ensures each
signed-in account can only access its own course rows.

On the first sign-in in a browser, the app imports the existing
`course-shelf-v1` local library into that account. It removes the browser copy
only after Supabase confirms the import succeeded.
